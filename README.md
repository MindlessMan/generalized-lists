# ðŸ§® Generalized List Polynomial Processor

A C++ implementation of generalized lists for recursive traversal and polynomial representation from a matrix input.

## ðŸ“– Description
This project demonstrates the use of generalized lists (nested, recursive data structures) to represent polynomials. Given a matrix of coefficients in a text file, the program:

Converts each row of the matrix into a polynomial term.

Constructs a generalized list to hierarchically organize terms.

Recursively traverses the list to print or evaluate the polynomial.
